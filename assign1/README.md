Running this file requires the following libraries along with python 3.6 or above:

1. Numpy
2. Tqdm

These can be installed by the following command:
```
python3 -m pip install numpy tqdm
```

Run `python3 main.py -h` to see the help.

The program needs the following arguments:

```
  -n NUM_PEERS, --num_peers NUM_PEERS
                        Number of peers
  -t NUM_TRANSACTIONS, --num_transactions NUM_TRANSACTIONS
                        Number of transactions generated by each peer
  -i INTERARRIVAL, --interarrival INTERARRIVAL
                        Mean of interarrivals between transactions
  -m MINING_TIME, --mining_time MINING_TIME
                        Average time to mine
  -z SLOW_PERCENT, --slow_percent SLOW_PERCENT
                        Percent of peers that are slow
```

For example, to run the simulation, run the following command:
```
python main.py -n 10 -t 50 -i 100 -m 200 -z 20
```

The data regarding each node is written in to files in the `data` folder.

An additional log file containing data regarding all the nodes is also created for convenience.
